# Instagram Data Analysis and Prediction

This project analyzes Instagram data using Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, and WordCloud. It also uses Scikit-learn for building a prediction model.

## Description

The project performs the following tasks:

1. **Data Loading and Cleaning:** Loads the Instagram data from a CSV file (`/content/Instagram data.csv`), handles missing values, and explores data types.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Visualizes data using histograms, pie charts, scatter plots, and word clouds to gain insights into post reach and engagement.
3. **Correlation Analysis:** Calculates the correlation between different numerical features and Impressions.
4. **Conversion Rate Calculation:** Determines the conversion rate from profile visits to follows.
5. **Prediction Model:** Uses a Random Forest Regressor to predict Impressions based on engagement metrics like likes, saves, comments, shares, profile visits, and follows.

## Dependencies

The project requires the following Python libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- plotly
- wordcloud
- scikit-learn

You can install these libraries using pip:

## Usage

1. Upload the Instagram data CSV file (`Instagram data.csv`) to your Colab environment.
2. Run the provided Python code in a Colab notebook.
3. The code will generate visualizations and output, including the prediction model's score and a sample prediction.

## Insights

- The project provides insights into the relationship between different engagement metrics and post impressions.
- It identifies the main sources of impressions, such as home feed, hashtags, and explore page.
- The word clouds highlight common words used in captions and hashtags.
- The prediction model can be used to estimate the potential impressions of future posts based on engagement metrics.

## Future Work

- Experiment with other prediction models to improve accuracy.
- Analyze the impact of different content types on engagement.
- Incorporate sentiment analysis of captions to understand audience reactions.
- Build an interactive dashboard for visualizing the data and insights.
